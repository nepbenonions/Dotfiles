# .dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. Feel free to copy anything you want, but at your own risk. 

## Prerequisites

I'm running macOS and EndeavourOS (i3wm) across a few different machines, with zsh as my choice of shell, and nix with home-manager as my preferred package manager.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [nix](https://nixos.org/)
* [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
* [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
